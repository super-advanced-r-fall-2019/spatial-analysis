Introduction to the sf package.
 * High level overview of plotting in R, why you would want to do it?
 * Overview of sf() package objects and why you should care
 * Reading and creating shapefiles and rasters
 * Applying transformations and spatial operations (e.g., creating a sampling grid)
 * Plotting using sf and ggplot2
 * Tips and tricks (including the issue I've grappled with a lot!)

Why I found sf package (workflow between ArcGIS, crashing, duplicated outputs)
Other packages for spatial stuff and why sf() (sp, RGeos, leaflet)

Think through a potential project/workflow and think about
what stuff would come up and how to address it. Although
I probably have enough time to go through and show what the underlying
functionality is.

ggmap from ggplot lecture
 * using map_data() to add background plots
 * point plots of average temp
 * polygon in map structure
 * Q: format of spatial objects? shapefile? sp?
 * A: depends on how comfortable you are, can find lots of stuff.
 * geom_polygon is pretty straightforward, can't deal with projecting

Lecture ran 1 pm to 2:45 pm (lots of content! but some is interactive)

Dan's ideas:
Keep overview super brief, lots of ways but this is a really nice way to go
Do your data come spatial? Turn lat/lon into shapefiles
Transforming coordinates
Installing it (can be hard for linux) --> leave time for that and troubleshooting
More time on actual spatial computations (e.g., intersections, sampling) rather than just making things look pretty.
Point out that sf is for vector data, raster version is in production
R Natural Earth package (database for maps, central repository)

Tidy spatial stuff--super easy to bring in non-spatial data and join it to spatial stuff
